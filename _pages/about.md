I am a member of the <a href='https://irmar.univ-rennes.fr/en/probability-statistics-and-ergodic-theory'> ergodic theory team</a> at the <a href='https://irmar.univ-rennes.fr/en'> IRMAR </a>. 

I work in the area of smooth dynamical systems, using techniques from ergodic theory and homogeneous dynamics. Lately, I have been particularly interested in the behavior of the horocycle flow in the moduli space of abelian differentials and related dynamical systems, such as the horospherical foliation in invariant subvarieties of the moduli spaces. I am also interested various applications  in counting problems on abelian differentials. During my PhD, I studied the behavior of the isoperiodic foliation and applications to the classification of invariant subvarieties.


Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
